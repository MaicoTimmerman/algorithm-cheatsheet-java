\subsection{Max flow}
\subsubsection{Edmonds-Karps (BFS)}
Path in residual graph searched via BFS. $O(|V||E|^2)$.\\
\lstinputlisting{Graphs/edmondskarps.java}
\subsubsection{Ford-Fulkerson}
Equals to Edmonds-Karps, vut with a DFS. $O(|E|f^*)$ where $f^*$ is the value of the max flow.

\subsubsection{Min cut}
We search, between two nodes $s$ and $t$, $V_1$ and $V_2$ so as $s\in V_1$, $t\in V_2$ and $\sum_{e \in E(V_1, V_2)} w(e)$ minimum.\\
We just have to compute the max-flow between $s$ and $t$ and to apply a BFS/DFS on the residual graph. All node which are visited are in $V_1$, others in $V_2$. The weight from the cut is the max-flow.
\subsubsection{Maximum weighted bipartite matching}
(Assignment problem)
