\subsection{DFS}
Equals to BFS with \textit{Stack} instead of \textit{Queue} or recursive implementation. Complexity $O(|V|+|E|)$\\
\lstinputlisting{Graphs/dfs.java}
\subsubsection{Topological order}
Graph must be acyclic. \\

\lstinputlisting{Graphs/toposort.java}
\subsubsection{Strongly connected components}
Uses BFS following the topologic order. \\

\subsubsection{SCC and Articulation Points in C}
C version of SCC (shorter).

\lstinputlisting{Graphs/scc1.cpp}

Articulation points.

\subsubsection{Directed Graph to toposorted DAG}
In $O(n + m)$, with Tarjan SCC algo,
we merge the SCCs and take the resulting DAG,
(remembering their size in \lstinline|scc_size|)
which is reverse toposorted (i.e. node 0 has no outgoing edge),
ready for bottom up DP (starting with node 0 ending with node $N$) !
